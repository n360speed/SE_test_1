I wanted to say that I never used python before, but thought it would be a great way to showcase
my skills in using unfamiliar languages to accomplish the task

Assumptions:
  * You have extracted the contents of this project
  * You have cd to the extracted directory

Required to run:
  * sudo apt install python3.6 python-pip
    * You should be able to use any python 3.0+ version
  * pip install requests

To run from command prompt:
  * python main.py
  * py main.py
  * python3.6 main.py

To run test, not pass fail, but way to test my logic:
  * python main.py test
  * cat test_agg.txt | awk '{print $1 "    " $2 "    " $3}'
